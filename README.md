# NYC Airbnb Data

## Summary

Since 2008, guests and hosts have used Airbnb to expand on traveling possibilities and present a more unique, personalized way of experiencing the world. Me and my group were interested in finding what factors appeal to guests and which factors influence each successful or unsuccessful bookings of certain Airbnbs i.e. is it popular tourist spots in the area or is it a geographical location that has more traffic? Successful bookings are those with a lot of reviews and unsuccessful bookings are those without many reviews. So perhaps if an Airbnb location is highly rated due to its many reviews, is it therefore considered to be more “trustworthy”? We will conduct this and other sorts of exploratory data analysis. Finally, we were also interested in predicting the rental price of different Airbnbs based on the other features present in the dataset.
